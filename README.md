# HTTP Server in Go

This repository contains my solution to the [Codecrafters "Build Your Own HTTP Server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

I implemented a basic HTTP server from scratch in Go, focusing on understanding the inner workings of the HTTP protocol. Throughout the project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Parsing HTTP requests
- Crafting appropriate HTTP responses
- Managing sockets and connections
- Handling different HTTP methods and status codes

This project was a valuable learning experience and deepened my understanding of how web servers operate under the hood.
